# Parse IRD (and PAT) summary files

This code is based on the original perl from `calvad_data_extract`
repository.  I pulled out the IRD code because I ran into an error
parsing the latest round and the testing there is a mess.

Modeled on the PAT javascript code, which is much nicer to test...more
modular and all that.
